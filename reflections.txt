You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

* In this challenge I canâ€™t say I learned new skills but I definitely practiced and gained depth of the things I already knew about HTML.  Actually, I got to know MND HTML Elements site which is a new site for me!  

* This challenge has been easy because I already had some knowledge of HTML and its elements. 

* Nothing so far. Hints really helped with the tags like <s> which I used for the first time. 

* The strategy here was to go line by line and do research instead of panicking and trying to run to a forum and ask questions.
